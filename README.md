A side-scrolling game heavily inspired by ‘Lone Survivor’, ‘Superbrothers: Sword and Sworcery’ as well as ‘Terraria’. 
The art style and controls are from the two former examples and the idea of a large world meant for exploring is from the latter. Not so much about crafting and surviving, the idea was to be a more mindful experience taking players through cool pixel-art environments and letting them explore and collect tokens to progress.

The controls are simple and easy to operate in order to create a serene experience while playing.
Collection of tokens must be collected in order for the player to escape in the end, however development never reached this stage.
